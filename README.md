# About me
Ciao! My name is Edoardo and I'm an undergraduate student at Bocconi, where I'm studying Mathematical and Computational Sciences for Artificial Intelligence. I'm deeply passionate about mathematics and algorithms, and my main interests lie in graph theory, optimization and geometric deep learning. My ambition is to work in the field of computational biology, as I find this path to be intriguing and purposeful, and I'm convinced that I can make a large positive impact by applying my skills to this area.

When I'm not coding or mathing around, you may find me hiking, practicing martial arts, or watching football.

I made this page to showcase some of my projects.
