# About me
Hi! My name is Edoardo and I'm an undergraduate student at Bocconi University, where I'm studying Mathematical and Computational Sciences for Aritficial Intelligence. I have a deep passion for mathematics and algorithms, and my main interests lie in graph theory, optimization and geometric deep learning. My ambition is to work in the field of computational biology, as I find this path to be both intriguing and purposeful, and I'm convinced that I can make a large positive impact by working in this area. When I'm not coding or mathing around, you may find me hiking or practicing martial arts. I made this page to showcase some of my projects.
