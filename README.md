# About me
Ciao! My name is Edoardo and I'm an undergraduate student at Bocconi, where I'm studying Mathematical and Computational Sciences for Artificial Intelligence. I'm deeply passionate about mathematics and algorithms, and my main interests lie in graph theory, optimization and geometric deep learning. My ambition is to work in the field of computational biology, as I find this path to be intriguing and purposeful, and I'm convinced that I can make a large positive impact by applying my skills to this area.

When I'm not coding or mathing around, you may find me hiking, practicing martial arts, or watching football.

I made this page to showcase some of my projects.

### Inferring protein abundance in cancer with boosting and deep learning
Proteins are fundamental actors in our bodies that carry out a wide range of critical cell functions. Understanding how diseases affect the protein landscape can reveal important insights into the biological mechanisms implicated in such diseases, and it can help in designing effective treatments. However, diseases are often better understood at the level of mRNA, which is easier to quantify precisely. Several studies have reported discordance between mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the relationship between the two is complex, noisy, and highly non-linear. Bridging this gap would provide a more comprehensive understanding of cellular function and regulatory mechanisms.

In an attempt to analyze at large scale the non-linear relationships between mRNA expression and protein abundance in cancer, we employ two popular state-of-the-art classes of non-linear methods: boosting and deep learning.
In particular, this work focuses on AdaBoost and XGBoost, latent representations from autoencoders, semi-supervised learning, and Transformer neural networks.
These complex techniques capture the hidden relationships between variables, elucidating the complex dynamics governing protein synthesis and regulation in cancer.
